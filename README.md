# CloseAll
It closes all your opened windows (It should).

Run the executable from CloseAll => bin => debug. 
Or put the .exe file in your cmd start folder and run it with [start CloseAll.exe] or do whatever you want.

Note: It simply does not care about your unsaved photoshop projects or unsaved essays about importanta comunicarii in familie.

It might have some collateral effects but idk, it works for me. I use it all the time.
